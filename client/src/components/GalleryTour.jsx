                        Nguyen Art Gallery has been established for original and quality Vietnamese paintings since 2006. We are recognized as one of the Top 10 Best Fine Art Galleries in Hanoi, Vietnam. The name Nguyen Art means “Original Art”. The Gallery’s objective is to promote quality arts from Vietnamese artists. Almost all artworks in our Gallery are oil on canvas paintings and lacquer paintings (son mai). The Gallery focuses on emerging Vietnamese artists. Their artworks express and communicate the imaginative aspects of their culture and reflect concerns that range broadly from the spiritual and aesthetic to the social and political.

                        Mr. Le Xuan Huong is the Gallery owner, an art collector and an Art Curator. Chatting with him, you will understand more about the artworks here as well as the development of Vietnamese modern art; also various stories about many Vietnamese artists with their lives, works and how they keep on their passion in the up and down of Vietnamese history in 20th Century. Enjoying Vietnamese coffee or tea, chatting with him at Art Space is your most memorial time in Hanoi.
