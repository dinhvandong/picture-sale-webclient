            The work is the spiritual child of the artist. The content is sometimes
            like reality, and sometimes like fantasy. It's true, but not entirely true. It's also a street, but the street in
            the photo is different from the street in the painting; or the muse in real life, when depicted in a painting, carries
            a completely different aura but still holds the essence, the beauty of real life.

            <span class="italic">"The talent of an artist is to bring real-life characters into artistic perspectives."</span> Drawing
            a portrait of a loved one, also known as a is one of the perennial inspirations
            for artists. Some artists draw themselves, their mothers, fathers, or angels in their lives, such as boys, girls, etc.
            But there are also art collectors, art enthusiasts who want to own paintings of their favorite people, idols...

          <p class="mb-4">
            And commissioned portrait painting has been strongly developed from practical needs. Commissioned painting is not simply
            about providing a topic and waiting for the artist to deliver the artwork on the appointed date. During the process of
            creating a painting based on a specific theme, the interaction between the owner of the artwork and the artist is
            always close, so that the owner can infuse their emotions, love, and familiarity into the artwork. The artist creates
            from the perspective of art, but interweaves the emotions of the owner into the artwork.
