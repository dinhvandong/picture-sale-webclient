The name Nguyen Art means “Original Art”. The Gallery’s objective is to promote quality art from Vietnamese artists. Almost all artworks in our Gallery are oil on canvas paintings and lacquer paintings (son mai). The Gallery focuses on emerging Vietnamese artists. Their artworks express and communicate the imaginative aspects of their culture and reflect concerns that range broadly from the spiritual and aesthetic to the social and political.
